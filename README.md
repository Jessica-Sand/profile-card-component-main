## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to center the elements in the middle of the screen something that I never know to do.
And I learned how to do pixel perfect, I hope so.

### Continued development

I would like to improve my css knowledge to avoid wasting time in research just to style simple things.
